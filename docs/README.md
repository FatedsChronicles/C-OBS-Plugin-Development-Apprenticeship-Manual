# ❤️ A Little Welcome From Me

I’m really glad you’re here.

Before we touch any code, I want to say something important — something I wish someone had said to me when I first tried learning C++:

**You don’t have to be “smart enough” to code.**\
You don’t have to know math.\
You don’t need tech experience.\
You definitely don’t need confidence… because that grows as you go.

All you need is curiosity… and patience with yourself.

This book — and this chapter — will hold your hand through every single step.\
No guessing.\
No skipping.\
No “you should already know this.”

Just a calm, steady journey forward.

Let’s begin.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn in This Chapter

By the time you finish Chapter 1, you’ll know how to:

* Install the tools you need
* Open your first code editor
* Type and run your first C++ program
* Fix simple setup mistakes
* Understand what “compiler,” “terminal,” and “build” actually mean
* Start thinking like a developer (gently, no pressure)

This chapter is all about **building confidence** — not complexity.

## 🧰 What You Need Before We Start

You will need:

✔ A Windows PC\
✔ A working internet connection\
✔ About 20–30 minutes\
✔ Zero programming experience

(We will cover Linux and macOS much later — when you’re building OBS plugins.)
